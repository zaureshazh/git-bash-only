This could be the very last kiss,
From my lil' Miss Perfect,
Certainly I savor that,
Funny how the money pays for stuff but doesn't pay for that,
Special little moment,
I know what I'm after,
Don't know what I'm aiming at,
Didn't mind the baby chat,
Or giving you my name and that,
The apple of my eye,
You puzzle me sometimes,
I need to find the apple guy and maybe he can make an act,
Feeling that, maybe we should take another roll of the dice.

Can't believe we both let it fade away,
I wanna stay for another day,
If you wanna save us, give me a signal,
Anything will do
Can't believe we both let it fade away,

I used to sleep like a baby,
Now I lay awake at night thinking 'bout my lady,
Maybe I should take a bite, maybe I should take a plunge,
Maybe I should cancel all my flights,
Take a right turn, left is just a place to run,
From my demons, no one understands me,
Better than my girl, 'cept my family,
And we hanging by a thread,
I go to turn my head,
Think twice, maybe,
Take another roll of the dice
