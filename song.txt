This could be the very last kiss,
From my lil' Miss Perfect,
Certainly I savor that,
Funny how the money pays for stuff but doesn't pay for that,
Special little moment,
I know what I'm after,
Don't know what I'm aiming at,
Didn't mind the baby chat,
Or giving you my name and that,
The apple of my eye,
You puzzle me sometimes,
I need to find the apple guy and maybe he can make an act,
Feeling that, maybe we should take another roll of the dice.
